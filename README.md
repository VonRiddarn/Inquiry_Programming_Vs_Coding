# Programming VS Coding

## About

In this inquiry I show that ones value as a programmer is tied to ones problem solving abilities rather than syntax knowledge.<br/>
This was done by creating the same program in 2 different languages and documenting the process.

## What did I learn? (Also see 'summary.pdf')

#### Language syntax vs logical programming<br/>
Programming is more about knowing patterns, data types and problem solving than actual
language syntax.<br/>
A versitile programmer will get the job done no matter the tools given, albeit, with varying
hits on performance and readability. It was obvious when creating this project that my lack
of Rust knowledge was holding me back immensly, but it wasn't stopping me from learning
and pushing through.<br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of times where I was cursing out Rust as a language because it didn't
work as I wanted it to, and I had to resolve issues in ways I wouldn't have chosen in a
language I know better, such as C# or C++.</br>
Even though it took me a lot longer, and the quality of the product is questionable I was
able to complete the task I was given in a language I have never even seen before.<br/>
<br/>
#### Time and cost<br/>
Although programming is not bound to a specific language you benefit a lot from
specializing in one language or framework as you will be able to learn language specific
optimizations and standards.<br/>
You will also be more proficent when using a syntax you
know by heart and don't have to look up every other method.<br/>
Due to my previous C# knowledge I was able to create a more proficient version of the
program in much less than half the time it took me in Rust. This means that being
specialized in languages is not a bad thing, as your proficency and speed increases the
more you use it.<br/>
<br/>
#### Going by this, what language should you learn if you're new?<br/>
Whichever language you want!<br/>
Although given the fact that data manipulation is one of the core concepts of logical
programming, I would recommend a language that is strictly typed.<br/>
This will force you to learn this important aspect early on.<br/>
The real answer though is:<br/>
Whatever language you have fun programming in.<br/>
<br/>
Learn one, learn all.
